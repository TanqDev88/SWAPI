## Description
In this repository a login form will be created where the user will log in with a username and password.

Form specifications:

The password field must have between 8 and 16 numeric characters and the user can only be an email. If the user or the password do not meet the validations, a message must be displayed indicating which of the two fields is incorrect and indicating how to correct the error.

Only the following user and password should be allowed to log in:

user: juanperez@gmail.com
password: 1787742836863899

‚¶Å Once the user enters the correct credentials, he/she accesses the system which allows him/her to search for the Start Wars character he/she wants to meet using an ID.
Once you enter the id, the data must be loaded asynchronously from the following REST service
URL : https://swapi.dev/api/people/5/ (the number 5 is the id of the character you want to display and it must be dynamic)

The data corresponding to the entered id must be displayed in a table and it must be validated that the id is a numeric field
